# 3 Mini Python Projects

Practicing Python with three fun beginner projects — **Pig Game**, **Mad Libs Generator**, and **Time Math Challenge** — inspired by [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/@TechWithTim)’s YouTube series.  
The **OOP versions** were implemented by me to practice object-oriented programming.
